# movies-app
Silly personal project for building an automated workflow for movies I've watched.

I watch a lot of movies. I like the idea of something like letterboxd but would rather DIY it because I have more time than sense, apparently. Anyway, that's what we have here - some code that will read a specially formatted page in Obsidian, enrich it with data from OMDB, then save all that to a SQLite database (as well as create a linked page in Obsidian for the movie if one doesn't already exist).
